/*
--Exercise 13--
Write a method called expunge that accepts a stack of integers as a parameter and makes sure that the stackâ€™s elements
are in non-decreasing order from top to bottom, by removing from the stack any element that is smaller than any
element(s) on top of it.

For example, if the stack stores [4, 20, 15, 15, 8, 5, 7, 12, 3, 10, 5, 1], the element values 3, 7, 5, 8, and 4 should
be removed because each has an element above it with a larger value. So your method should change the stack to store
[20, 15, 15, 12, 10, 5, 1].

Notice that now the elements are in non-decreasing order from top to bottom. If the stack is empty or has just one
element, nothing changes.

Use one queue or stack (but not both) as auxiliary storage.
