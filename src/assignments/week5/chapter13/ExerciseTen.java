--Exercise 10--
Write the state of the elements of each of the following arrays after each pass of the outermost loop of the selection
sort algorithm has occurred (after each element is selected and moved into place).


int[] numbers3 = {8, 5, –9, 14, 0, –1, –7, 3};
int[] numbers4 = {15, 56, 24, 5, 39, –4, 27, 10};

A:
1) numbers3 = {-9, 5, 8, 14, 0, –1, –7, 3}                          numbers4 = {-4, 56, 24, 5, 39, 15, 27, 10}
2) numbers3 = {-9, -7, 8, 14, 0, –1, 5, 3}                          numbers4 = {-4, 5, 24, 56, 39, 15, 27, 10}
3) numbers3 = {-9, -7, -1, 14, 0, 8, 5, 3}                          numbers4 = {-4, 5, 10, 56, 39, 15, 27, 24}
4) numbers3 = {-9, -7, -1, 0, 14, 8, 5, 3}                          numbers4 = {-4, 5, 10, 15, 39, 56, 27, 24}
5) numbers3 = {-9, -7, -1, 0, 3, 8, 5, 14}                          numbers4 = {-4, 5, 10, 15, 24, 56, 27, 39}
6) numbers3 = {-9, -7, -1, 0, 3, 5, 8, 14}                          numbers4 = {-4, 5, 10, 15, 24, 27, 56, 39}
7) numbers3 = {-9, -7, -1, 0, 3, 5, 8, 14}                          numbers4 = {-4, 5, 10, 15, 24, 27, 39, 56}
