What indexes will be examined as the middle element by a binary search for each of the following target values?
What value will be returned?

a) 65
A: Binary search will examine indexes 6, 10 and 8 as the middle elements. The value returned will be 8.

b) 9
A: Binary search will examine indexes 6, 3, 1 and 2 as the middle elements. The value returned will be -1.

c) 90
A: Binary search will examine indexes 6, 10 and 12 as the middle elements. The value returned will be 12.
