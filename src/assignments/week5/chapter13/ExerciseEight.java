sort algorithm has occurred (after each element is selected and moved into place).


int[] numbers1 = {63, 9, 45, 72, 27, 18, 54, 36};
int[] numbers2 = {37, 29, 19, 48, 23, 55, 74, 12};

A:
1) numbers1 = {9, 63, 45, 72, 27, 18, 54, 36}                   numbers2 = {12, 29, 19, 48, 23, 55, 74, 37}
2) numbers1 = {9, 18, 45, 72, 27, 63, 54, 36}                   numbers2 = {12, 19, 29, 48, 23, 55, 74, 37}
3) numbers1 = {9, 18, 27, 72, 45, 63, 54, 36}                   numbers2 = {12, 19, 23, 48, 29, 55, 74, 37}
4) numbers1 = {9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 63, 54, 72}                   numbers2 = {12, 19, 23, 29, 48, 55, 74, 37}
5) numbers1 = {9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72}                   numbers2 = {12, 19, 23, 29, 37, 55, 74, 48}
6) numbers1 = {9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72}                   numbers2 = {12, 19, 23, 29, 37, 48, 74, 55}
7) numbers1 = {9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72}                   numbers2 = {12, 19, 23, 29, 37, 48, 55, 74}
