int[] list = {–2, 8, 13, 22, 25, 25, 38, 42, 51, 103};

What indexes will be examined as the middle element by a binary search for each of the following target values?
What value will be returned?

a) 103
A: Binary search will examine indexes 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 as the middle elements. The value 9 will be returned.

b) 30
A: Binary search will examine indexes 4, 6, 5 and 5 as the middle elements. The value returned will be -1.

c) 8
A: Binary search will examine indexes 4, 2 and 1 as the middle elements. The value returned will be 1.
