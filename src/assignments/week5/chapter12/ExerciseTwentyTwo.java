--Exercise 22--

Write a recursive method called subsets to find every possible sub-list of a given list. A sub-list of a list L
contains 0 or more of Lâ€™s elements. Your method should accept a list of strings as its parameter and print every
sub-list that could be created from elements of that list, one per line.

For example, if the list stores [Janet, Robert, Morgan, Char], the output from your method would be:

[Janet, Robert, Morgan, Char]
[Janet, Robert, Morgan]
[Janet, Robert, Char]
[Janet, Robert]
[Janet, Morgan, Char]
[Janet, Morgan]
[Janet, Char]
[Janet]
[Robert, Morgan, Char]
[Robert, Morgan]
[Robert, Char]
[Robert]
[Morgan, Char]
[Morgan]
[Char]
[]
The order in which you show the sub-lists does not matter, and the order of the elements of each sub-list also
does not matter. The key thing is that your method should produce the correct overall set of sub-lists as its output.
Notice that the empty list is considered one of these sub-lists.
You may assume that the list passed to your method is not null and that the list contains no duplicates.
Do not use any loops.
