--Exercise 16--

Write a method called triangleArea that accepts the three side lengths of a triangle as parameters and
returns the area of a triangle with those side lengths.

For example, the call triangleArea(8, 5.2, 7.1) should return 18.151176098258745.

To compute the area, use Heronâ€™s formula, which states that the area of a triangle whose three sides have lengths
a, b and c, is the following.

The formula is based on the computed value s, a length equal to half the perimeter of the triangle:

s = (a + b + c) / 2
area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
