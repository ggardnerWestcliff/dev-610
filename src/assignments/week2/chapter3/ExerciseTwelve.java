--Exercise 12--

Write a method called scientific that accepts a real number base and an exponent as parameters and computes the
base times 10 to the exponent, as seen in scientific notation.

For example, the call of scientific(6.23, 5) would return 623000.0 and the call of scientific(1.9, â€“2)
would return 0.019.
