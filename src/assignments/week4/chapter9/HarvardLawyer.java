--Exercise 3--
Write a class HarvardLawyer to accompany the other law firm classes described in this chapter. Harvard lawyers are like
normal lawyers, but they make 20% more money than a normal lawyer, they get 3 days more vacation, and they have to fill
out four of the lawyerâ€™s forms to go on vacation. That is, the getVacationForm method should return "pinkpinkpinkpink".
Make sure to interact with the superclass as appropriate.
