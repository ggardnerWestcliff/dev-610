--Exercise 18--

Write a pseudocode algorithm that will produce the following figure as output:

+===+===+
|   |   |
|   |   |
|   |   |
+===+===+
|   |   |
|   |   |
|   |   |
+===+===+


Pseudocode Algorithm:
for (design going 1 to 2) {
    for (character group going 1 to 2) {
        write 1 plus character.
        for (character going 1 to 3) {
            write an equals character.
        }
    }
    write 1 plus character.
    start a new line.
    for (line going 1 to 3) {
        for (column going 1 to 2) {
            write 1 vertical bar.
            for (character going 1 to 3) {
                write a whitespace character.
            }
            write 1 vertical bar.
        }
    }
}
start a new line.
write 1 plus sign followed by 3 equals signs followed by 1 plus sign followed by 3 equals signs followed by 1 plus sign.
