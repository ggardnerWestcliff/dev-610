--Exercise 3--

Write a method called negativeSum that accepts a Scanner reading input from a file containing a series of integers,
and print a message to the console indicating whether the sum starting from the first number is ever negative.
You should also return true if a negative sum can be reached and false if not.

For example, suppose the file contains the following text:

38 4 19 -27 -15 -3 4 19 38

Your method would consider the sum of just one number (38), the first two numbers (38 + 4), the first three numbers
(38 + 4 + 19), and so on to the end. None of these sums is negative, so the method would produce the following
output and return false:

no negative sum

If the file instead contains the following numbers:

14 7 -10 9 -18 -10 17 42 98

The method finds that a negative sum of âˆ’8 is reached after adding the first six numbers.
It should output the following to the console and return true:

sum of -8 after 6 steps
