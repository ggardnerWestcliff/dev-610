--Exercise 7--

Write a method called flipLines that accepts a Scanner for an input file and writes to the console the same fileâ€™s
contents with each pair of lines reversed in order.
If the file contains an odd number of lines, leave the last line unmodified.

For example, if the file contains:

Twas brillig and the slithy toves
did gyre and gimble in the wabe.
All mimsey were the borogroves,
and the mome raths outgrabe.

your method should produce the following output:

did gyre and gimble in the wabe.
Twas brillig and the slithy toves
and the mome raths outgrabe.
All mimsey were the borogroves,
